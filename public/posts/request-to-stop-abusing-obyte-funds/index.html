    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In December 2018 I discovered by chance that Steve Safronoff and Luke Angell had attempted to obtain 1 million Euros from the undistributed Obyte funds. Broadly speaking, they wanted to go travelling around the world with their friends during 2019, paid for using investors money.</p>
<p>By this stage, Steve had already been employed by Obyte as Head of Business Development for 18 months. It was clear to everyone that not only did Steve have absolutely no idea what he was doing, he was also incredibly lazy. Luke had been in his role for 9 months. Neither had any interest in crypto or Obyte, they both got jobs at Obyte due to their personal connections to founder Tony Churyumoff who controls all the money.</p>
<p>In late January 2019, Tony forwarded me an email thread from Cointelegraph who wanted to sell Obyte advertising. The Cointelegraph person had emailed Tony several reminders about the offer. By this stage I had been working on Obyte (both as a volunteer and paid) for around 1 year. I had witnessed a lot of bullshit from Steve Safronoff, and I was furious that he and Luke had attempted to obtain 1 million Euros by going behind everyone&rsquo;s backs for what was clearly an awful plan. I replied to Tony, Steve, Luke and various others on the Obyte team with the following email:</p>
<h3 id="email-starts">(email starts)</h3>
<p>true Tony, but I believe we should learn from them:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the email follow up is probably done automatically by software, I have done this before in my own work and its effective. It is likely Christina is not manually sending these emails, but added us to an automated sequence. Looks like you are an annoying sales person, but some people admire hustle and it catches their attention.  Like you here, Tony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is smart, targeted marketing at little cost. all crypto projects want news coverage, and coin telegraph has eyeballs. this is smart marketing, even if its not the most elegant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steve I am extremely unimpressed with Obyte business development strategy and execution. The current strategy of basically attending conferences/events around the world hoping you meet legitimate, well funded projects that want to build on Obyte is in my view, poor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, this strategy has had virtually no tangible results that I can see, so its not just my view, but backed up by data (or lack of it). Not only is the strategy poor, but its very disorganized. Not having a CRM is simply inexcusable, and I can confidently assume there is zero systematized pipleline workflows in place either.  That said, the strategy is so poor that having these probably wouldnt bring much success anyway, but it would at least add some credibility and organization to what is being attempted.</p>
<p>Steve you have been head of business development for well over 1 year (nearly 2?), and I see little evidence of business development being done. You may think this is harsh, but you are head of business development and with this role comes accountability for business development. Worse, there is a plan to attempt far more of this failing strategy and spend 1 million Euros in 2019 alone during the process.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>I would end the current chasing balls business development strategy immediately, its throwing good money after bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we are to continue with business development, I would start testing direct response marketing which is much easier and cheaper to test, not too dissimilar to what Coin Telegraph is doing with us. It consists of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. build contact lists of people we think might want to build using Obyte
b. contact them and see if there is interest.</p>
<p>Isnt one of the main aims of business development to find people that want to build on the platform? These people are online, we can experiment with ways of reaching them.  Spending small amounts of money testing this sort of thing would make far more sense than spending large amounts of money attending conferences all over the world hoping we meet Mr Big that wants to build on Obyte. My idea might get zero tangible results either, but it doesnt cost much to test.</p>
<p>I have experience doing this in my legal marketing work, though obviously crypto is a different sector, but the principals are similar. I have been thinking of suggesting it to Tony, but I am busy doing what I currently do at Obyte and don&rsquo;t have time to do both. I thought about suggesting me working 70% on business development and 30% on content, but to be honest Ive a feeling what might is we wouldnt get somebody to help out with the content, so instead I would end up working 100+ hours a week which I am not doing. 50-60 hours a week yes, 100+ no.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow is Friday, not a great day to address strategy. I would like to discuss business development with Tony and those interested next week. I think we could try discussing it on a private Discord group instead of the Skype</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<h3 id="email-ends">(email ends)</h3>
<p>My request was rejected by Tony. Steve and Luke were given large amounts of money for their awful plan which surprise, surprise, resulted in absolutely nothing. Further, both Steve and Luke lied to everyone on the Obyte team about the &lsquo;work&rsquo; they were doing throughout 2019. The &lsquo;work&rsquo; did not exist, it was all a bunch of lies which Tony finally admitted in October 2019. To this day Tony and Steve refuse to reveal how much money was wasted in salaries and expenses, despite multiple written and verbal requests to do so.</p>
<p>Steve and Luke are still on the Obyte payroll.</p>
