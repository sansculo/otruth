        A sneaky attempt to blow €1 million of Obyte funds by Steve Safronoff and Luke Angell

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Two people on the Obyte team, Steve Safronoff and Luke Angell, sneakily tried to get their hands on €1 million from the undistributed funds, with a plan anyone could see was awful. They did end up obtaining a large amount, but founder Tony, who controls all the money, refuses to reveal how much he gave them. First a little bit of background on how this happened.
Steve Safronoff hired When Tony publicly launched Obyte at the end of 2016, Steve was not part of the project.

      Background In December 2018 I discovered by chance that Steve Safronoff and Luke Angell had attempted to obtain 1 million Euros from the undistributed Obyte funds. Broadly speaking, they wanted to go travelling around the world with their friends during 2019, paid for using investors money.
By this stage, Steve had already been employed by Obyte as Head of Business Development for 18 months. It was clear to everyone that not only did Steve have absolutely no idea what he was doing, he was also incredibly lazy.

      Obyte was called Byteball until January 2019. The concept of a name change is not difficult to understand. For Steve Safronoff, though, Head of Business Development, 18 months after the name change he still doesn&rsquo;t even know who he is meant to be working for. In fact using the word work is misleading as Steve avoids doing anything that resembles work. Take a look at his LinkedIn profile as of June 2020:
