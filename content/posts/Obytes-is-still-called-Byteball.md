Obyte was called Byteball until January 2019. The concept of a name change is not difficult to understand. For Steve Safronoff, though, Head of Business Development, 18 months after the name change he still doesn't even know who he is meant to be working for. In fact using the word work is misleading as Steve avoids doing anything that resembles work. Take a look at his LinkedIn profile as of June 2020:

Isn't it rather odd that as someone with the job title of Head of Business Development, Steve cannot even get the name correct of who he is supposedly working for? LinkedIn is the biggest professional networking website in the world, updating your employers name change (a 1 minute task) wouldn't be difficult. Perhaps one reason Steve has not changed the Byteball references is because Steve is almost illiterate. Steve needs help with even the most basic of tasks, like how to register on a website. 

He travels around the world claiming to represent Obyte on top secret business and this worldwide travel fetish is funded by investors (investors which Steve denies exist). Every month his good friend Tony Churyumoff sends $10,000 (salary) + large travel expenses from the Obyte funds to Steve. The top secret important business that Steve claims to be working on does not exist.

He has been on the Obyte (not Byteball, Steve) payroll since mid 2017, so the fraud is nearly 3 years old. Steve has been asked several times to change this to Obyte but he doesn't bother. He doesn't need to do anything, because Tony will pay Steve anyway, and Tony controls all the money.
