## Background

Otruth was created by me, Paul Murray. In March 2018 I was contacted by someone on the core Obyte team and offered a paid role doing digital content, which I accepted. I was part of the core team from April 2018 to March 2020.

## Serious problems at Obyte

Soon after I joined it became obvious that there were serious problems. People were on the team, e.g. Steve Safronoff, that had no interest in Obyte or even cryptocurrency in general, with their high salaries paid from the undistributed funds. There was no urgency, no work ethic, and in some cases an inability to do even the most simple of tasks, like write stuff down or manage a to-do list. Various people had been given well paid jobs not because of their competency or interest in Obyte, but due to direct or indirect personal connections to the founder Tony Churyumoff who controlled all the money. 

The claim that “98% of funds will be distributed for free” had turned into a cronyism. Obyte hiring and the question about what to do with the remaining funds looked like a scene from a private members club in 19th century England. I was absolutely disgusted.

## Team dumping the price of Bytes

A key reason the price of Bytes has fallen so much since 2018 is that people on the Obyte payroll sell their salaries and expense claims for Bitcoin. Bytes have little liquidity, and when multiple people on high salaries sell their Bytes the price dumps. 

For example, Steve Safronoff has been on the Obyte payroll for 3 years and during that time has been paid around $300,000 in salary and expenses (e.g. cruise holidays. Yes, really). Not only is using the undistributed funds to pay such people totally unethical, it's a lot of sell pressure on thinly traded Bytes. 

## End all Obyte team salaries immediately

The easiest, fastest way to fix the problem is to end all Obyte team salaries and expense claims immediately.

Obyte is an open source project, many such projects are run 100% by volunteers, and there are already people that volunteer their time for Obyte. The project already has far more features than most cryptocurrencies, adding additional features when few people are using existing features makes little sense.

Continuing to pay salaries to those in non development roles is even less justifiable. This particularly applies to the people that have long track records of deceptive behaviour and should never have been hired in the first place. Steve is one of these people, but he is not the only one.

## The remaining undistributed funds

The full moon airdrops to grow the network did not work as hoped, but they worked a lot better than giving fat salaries and travel expenses to people that had no interest in Obyte or cryptocurrency in the first place. For the remaining funds I suggest considering a return of the full moon airdrops but time locking the funds e.g. for 12 months. If anyone has other ideas then please share them.
