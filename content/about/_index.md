I was part of the Obyte core team from April 2018 to March 2020. During my time there I made multiple written and verbal requests for unacceptable things to change such as payroll fraud, expense fraud and shambolic management. My requests were ignored.

The broad aim of Otruth is to end all team salaries and expense claims immediately. Regardless of what happens, Obyte is very likely to fail. However it should fail whilst honest people are doing honest work which is far from what is happening.
